Tell me when the lights go out
What do you dream about?
Do you run or do you fall?
So tell me, when you're lying there
Do you doubt or don't you care
Has a dawn left a mark on your mind?

I hope what you do you think is right
I hope you sleep at night
I hope what you do you think is right
Oh, I hope you sleep at night
Cause I wouldn't if I were you
